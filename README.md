* This is the project of the thesis 'Exploring the Structure of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease By Analyzing Molecular Dynamics Simulation Data', and the structure of the project is listed below:

* Figure_1: The structure of all the programming files, and they can be found in the directory ‘programming’. In the figure, the file with a red name is valid, the file with a blue name is used for adjustment and testing in the process, and the file with a green name is related to the display of the project.
